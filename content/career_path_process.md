# Career Path Process

To go from one level to the next in the [career path](career_path.md):

1. Make sure you understand the role description in the career path
1. Start acting like the role you want to become - if you want to become a senior architect, start acting like one
1. Get help from your manager if you are unsure or need coaching about the requirements
1. When you are ready to make the assessment, email your manager where you state:
    1. Which role you want to be assessed for
    1. Concrete examples of how you have satisfied all requirements of the role for at least 6 months consistently
    1. The name of a person who can validate your characteristics and accomplishments
1. Management team will review your assessment
    * If you succeed the assessment, your new title will be updated immediately in people systems
    * If you fail the assessment, you will get feedback on what areas you need to improve to make the step
