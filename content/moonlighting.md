# A Note About Moonlighting

Moonlighting means working for other companies with ``substantial`` time and/or dealine obligations outside of your work at Stakater. It’s not a black and white topic. There are one-time gigs, other pursuits, or opportunities that help you grow and make life interesting. ``We want to support that``. But we want to make sure professional endeavors outside of Stakater don’t create conflicts of interest or affect your time, dedication, or performance at Stakater. So it’s a delicate balance.

With that in mind, here are some examples of what we’d consider a conflict of interest and not OK:

## Not OK

1. You can’t work full time or part time for another company in our industry. If you’re unclear about what our industry is, and you have a specific situation you’d like to talk about, ask management.

2. Go out on a regular speaking circuit tour which is going to require multiple days of travel multiple times a year. That’s too disruptive to our own work schedule and to your fellow teammates.

3. Consult for other companies in our industry where there may be a conflict of interest (a competitor, a product tangentially related to Stakater, etc).

4. Be aggressive in marketing your availability for side work. If something comes to you through a friend or some connection, fine, but aggressively promoting something on the side will ultimately result in a conflict of interest here at work.

5. Take on anything outside of work that’ll pull attention from work. For example, if you wanted to launch an app, but the app requires providing timely customer support to people who use the app, that’s going to eat into your day here at work. That would ultimately be a problem.

## In general

Here’s a few guiding principles about whether something could be a problem:

* Is it competitive against Stakater's product & services?
* Would my part time work violates Stakater's NDA?
* Does it occupy a disproportionate amount of your time?
* Does it require you to be away during regular working hours?

In general we’d like to be lenient within reason, but we’re going to be strict if we see it impact your time, attention, or performance here at work.

It’s hard to come up with one-size fits all rules. If you’re in doubt, ``feel free to reach out to management``. We’re always happy to spare a moment to give our thoughts on it before you make a commitment.
